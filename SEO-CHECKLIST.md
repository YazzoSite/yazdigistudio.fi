## 🚀 Google Indexing Optimization Guide

### How to Speed Up Google Re-Indexing

When migrating to a new site or updating content, follow these steps to get Google to index the new version quickly:

#### Step 1: Submit Sitemap (Most Important)
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to "Sitemaps" in left menu
3. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Submit"
5. **Result:** Google starts crawling within hours

#### Step 2: Request Indexing for Key Pages (Priority Crawl)
1. Go to "URL Inspection" in left menu
2. Enter the full URL (e.g., `https://clientdomain.com`)
3. Click "Test URL"
4. Click "Request Indexing"
5. **Result:** Priority crawl within 24-48 hours

**Important URLs to request indexing for:**
- Homepage
- Other important pages as needed

**Note:** You can only request indexing for a limited number of URLs per day (usually 10-20).

#### Step 3: Manual Sitemap Ping (Optional)
Visit this URL in your browser to manually ping Google:
```
https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://clientdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

#### Step 4: Remove Old Cached Pages (Optional)
If old site content still appears in Google:
1. Go to: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals
2. Request removal of outdated URLs
3. Wait for removal to process (24-48 hours)

### Expected Timeline for Re-Indexing

- ⏳ **Sitemap submitted:** Crawling starts within 1-6 hours
- ⏳ **Request indexing:** Priority crawl in 24-48 hours
- ⏳ **Natural re-crawl:** 1-2 weeks without action
- ⏳ **Full re-indexing:** 2-4 weeks for all pages
- ⏳ **Old cache replaced:** 2-4 weeks for complete update

### Monitoring Index Status

In Google Search Console, monitor:
1. **Coverage Report:** Shows which pages are indexed
2. **Sitemaps Report:** Shows sitemap status and discovered URLs
3. **Performance Report:** Shows search rankings and clicks
4. **URL Inspection:** Check specific page index status

### Sitemap Updates

**When to update sitemap.xml:**
- After adding new pages or content
- When making significant content changes
- Monthly as best practice

**Current sitemap:**
- Location: `/public/sitemap.xml`
- URLs included: 5 (home, about, gallery, media, contact)

**Update process:**
1. Edit `public/sitemap.xml`
2. Update `<lastmod>` dates to current date
3. Commit and push changes
4. Re-submit to Google Search Console (optional, Google will discover automatically)

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Google says "URL not found"

**Issue:** "Couldn't find your verification token"
- **Solution:** Ensure verification file is in `/public/` folder and deployed

**Issue:** Sitemap errors
- **Solution:** Validate sitemap at https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html

## 💡 SEO Best Practices for Portfolio Sites

### Content Tips:
1. **Name everywhere:** Use full name in headers, titles, content
2. **Job titles:** Repeat profession naturally throughout content
3. **Credits:** List shows, productions, projects (with names)
4. **Location:** Mention city, country for local SEO
5. **Fresh content:** Update regularly via CMS (Google loves fresh content)

### Image SEO:
```html
<!-- Good example -->
<img
  src="/images/client-headshot.jpg"
  alt="[Client Name] - [Professional Description]"
  title="[Client Name] professional photo"
/>

<!-- Bad example -->
<img src="/img1.jpg" alt="photo" />
```

### Internal Linking:
- Link from Home → Gallery → About → Contact
- Use descriptive anchor text: "View professional photos" not "Click here"

---

- Strong presence for name + any keyword combination

### Ongoing:
- Maintain #1 position for name searches
- Build authority through links and fresh content
